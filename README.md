# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to compare the average prices of fares of the riding sharing app Pyber. Prices were split into three categories by region type- urban, suburban, and rural. The average prices were graphed over a period of four months to show how the amounts fluxuated over time for each region.

## Results
The total number of rides for rural, suburban, and urban consecutively were 125, 625, and 1625; with 78, 490, and 2405 total drivers each. The total fares in USD were $4,327.93, $19,356.33, and $39,854.34. The average fares per ride were $34.62, $30.97, and $24.56; while the average per driver were $55.49, $39.50, and $16.58. The total fares by city type are reflected in the graph over a period of four months. The data shows that the most expensive fares on average were in the rural city type. This is due to the lack of drivers in rural areas- there were approximately 2,300 more drivers in urban areas. This would imply a higher demand for rides in rural areas, which would allow the drivers to earn more per ride.
